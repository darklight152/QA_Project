Hi!  I'd like to take a moment to explain the application and how to get it to work.

Open the main.java application in any Java IDE (I used Eclipse) if you encounter an ANT build error you may need to create a new application and just copy/paste the code in.  I hope that doesn't happen!

Once the application is up and running you have to change the location of the XML file as that is unique to each computer.

File fXmlFile = new File("C:/Users/Matthew/Documents/userInfo.xml");

Has to be changed to where the xml XML file is located on your computer.  If you copy/paste the directory you will have to change back slashes to forward slashes!

Hit run application and everything should work!
